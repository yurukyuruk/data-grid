--search button--
Debounce should happen in search button. everytime debounce finish you need to dispatch an event (event filter data) 
and you need to recieve filter event in data grid.
You need to pass in this event information about filter phrase(user input) and then you need to use config service 
to save the input in local storage and in config service(like this.sortingrules you will have this.filteringrules).
then you should call createRows(at the beginning of createrows clear innderhtml of datarows).
Do the same for hide columns and sorting.
Add enum for custom events.
const x = localStorage.getitem("lol");
if(x !== null) {
    const a = x;
}
Change the name of mySortingSection!
Check the order of your functions clicking the sort apply button.
