## Project Description
Data-Grid app displays given data in a user friendly way by providing multiple displaying options. 
Number of data-rows and columns to be displayed are flexible and will be created depending on provided data structure. 
User can display only desired columns and hide some of them, or can display sup-columns as expanded or collapsed, 
or can assign index numbers to columns to display them in desired order by default, by editing configuration.
It is also possible to display data-columns or rows in different orders during usage. **SORT DATA** button is 
used to sort data-rows by one or multi column-header names and display them in ascending or descending order as preferred. 
Columns can be hidden or displayed via **HIDE COLUMN** button. It is also possible to search needed data-rows by 
using **SEARCH BAR**.
