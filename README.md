## Project Description
Data-Grid app displays given data in a user friendly way by providing multiple displaying options. Number of data-rows and columns to be displayed are flexible and will be created depending on provided data structure. User can display only desired columns and hide some of them, or can display sup-columns as expanded or collapsed, or can assign index numbers to columns to display them in desired order by default, by editing configuration.It is also possible to display data-columns or rows in different orders during usage.
## Features
- ### Sort Data
**SORT DATA** button is used to sort data-rows by header names and display them in ascending or descending order as preferred. New sort options can be added by clicking add button and user can have different sort options as much as the number of headers and easily combine them.
- ### Hide Column
Each columns can be hidden or displayed via **HIDE COLUMN** button. All user needs to do is clicking on the checkbox next to the column name. On each click column display options will toggle and the column will be hidden or displayed that way.
